    <h2>Introduction :</h2>
    <p>The Hare and the Tortoise’ is one of Aesop’s best-known fables. The meaning or ‘moral’ of the fable is worth analysing more closely, however, and the story has attracted a number of competing – indeed, actively conflicting – interpretations. So let’s take a closer look at the meaning of ‘The Hare and the Tortoise’ (sometimes known as ‘The Tortoise and the Hare’). <br> Once upon a time, a hare who was very proud of his speed challenged a tortoise to a race. The tortoise accepted the challenge, and the race began. The hare took off quickly, running as fast as he could, while the tortoise slowly plodded along. However, the hare soon became overconfident and decided to take a nap, thinking he had plenty of time to win the race. Meanwhile, the tortoise continued on at a steady pace, not stopping until he crossed the finish line.</p>

    <h2>Ending... : </h2>
    <p>You know the end of the story but how it was done is not. so, hare was sleeping because of his overconfident, he thought that tortoise is too far from finishing line and he ran too slowly so he could not finish the race first. When the hare woke up, he realized the tortoise had won the race. He felt embarrassed and ashamed of himself for underestimating the tortoise and taking his speed for granted.Even though the tortoise was slow, he was consistent and determined, which allowed him to succeed in the end.</p>

    <h2>Moral of The Story :</h2>
    <p> Failure of one time is not a failure of always, provided, one should take the lesson and correct the mistakes” . Slow and steady always wins the race. Never give up. Always keep going. Even if you are slow, your steadiness and consistency will let you win in any situation. </p>
